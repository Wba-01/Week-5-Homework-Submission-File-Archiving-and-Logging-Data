### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
tar -xvf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
tar -cvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude-tag-under=Java ~/Projects/TarDocs
3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
tar -tf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep -rw Java *

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:
sudo tar --listed-incremental=snapshot.file -cvzf logs_backup.tar.gz /var/log

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
You cannot create a tar file and also extract at the same time

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
0 6 * * 3 tar -czf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log
---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
sudo mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:
sudo nano system.sh

#!/bin/bash

# INSTRUCTIONS: Edit the following placeholder command and output filepaths
# For example: cpu_usage_tool > ~/backups/cpuuse/cpu_usage.txt
# The cpu_usage_tool is the command and ~/backups/cpuuse/cpu_usage.txt is the filepath
# In the above example, the `cpu_usage_tool` command will output CPU usage information into a `cpu_usage.txt` file.
# Do not forget to use the -h option for free memory, disk usage, and free disk space

# Free memory output to a free_mem.txt file
free -mh | awk 'NR==2{printf "Memory Usage: %s/%sMB (%.2f%%)\n", $3,$2,$3*100/$2 }' > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

# Disk usage output to a disk_usage.txt file
df -h | awk '$NF=="/"{printf "Disk Usage: %d/%dGB (%s)\n", $3,$2,$5}' > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

# List open files to a open_list.txt file
lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

# Free disk space to a free_disk.txt file
df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt


3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
chmod +x system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
sudo ./system.sh
cat ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:
sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.weekly

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

  /var/log/auth.log {  
  Weekly  
  rotate 7  
  Notifempty  
  Delaycompress  
  Missingok  
  endscript  
}

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:
sudo systemctl status auditd

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:
sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    max_log_file = 35
    num_logs = 7

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:
    sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules

-w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit
-w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit
-w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit

4. Command to restart `auditd`:
sudo systemctl restart auditd

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:
sudo auditctl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report:
sudo aureport -au

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:
sudo useradd attacker 
sudo aureport -m 

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:
sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:
sudo auditctl -l

---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:
sudo journalctl -b -p emerg..err

2. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:
sudo journalctl -b -u systemd-journald | less

3. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:
sudo journalctl --vacuum-files=2

4. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:
sudo su
journalctl -p 0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt

5. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:
sudo crontab -e

   @daily journalctl -p 0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
